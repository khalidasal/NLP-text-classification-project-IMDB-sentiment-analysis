# NLP-text-classification-project-IMDB-sentiment-analysis
This is an natural language processing based text classification project using the IMDB dataset from hugging face. 
IMDB is an leading website for finding movies and tv shows. Users can search for movies and tv shows and write positive or negative reviews. Given that an average person wastes plenty of time searching for movies that they would like, IMDB wants to recommend movies based on the users preferences. 
For this purpose, we will build an NLP based text classification model to predict user sentiments based on their past reviews. If successful, this model can help IMDB recommend movies to the users based on the preferences derived from their past reviews about movies. IMDB can benefit from this model by improving user retention and engagement.

The IMDB dataset was imported from hugging face. It contains 2 features titled text and label with 25000 rows split into train, test and unsupervised sets.
